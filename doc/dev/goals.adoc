=== Design goals

The layout and routing of schematic/dataflow diagrams that minimize crossings is a non-trivial optimization/algorithmic
problem (https://github.com/godotengine/godot-proposals/issues/1401[godotengine/godot-proposals#1401]). However, that is
neither the most complex nor the most important feature to implement. This project can get along with a _just good enough_
connection routing solution. Layout and routing has been thoroughly studied and is known to work well enough. Instead, this
project is focused on some more _interesting_ ideas. In this context, "interesting" means "not attempted before" (thus,
undocumented) or "no public/open implementation available, although the feature is known in some vendor/commercial product".

==== (V)HDL centric design

The workflow needs to be (V)HDL centric. That is, hardware designers working with VHDL 2008 sources and using
https://github.com/VUnit/vunit[VUnit] for managing regression tests should NOT need to modify their sources in order to use
Hardware Studio.

There is an abstract language model project written in Python: https://github.com/vhdl/pyVHDLModel[pyVHDLModel]. The motivation
is abstracting parser engines and allowing building tools on top of a standardised API. Unfortunately, there is still no open
source, complete and documented parser for VHDL 2008 which interacts with it. See detailed discussions
in https://github.com/jeremiah-c-leary/vhdl-style-guide/issues/312[jeremiah-c-leary/vhdl-style-guide#312] and
https://github.com/jeremiah-c-leary/vhdl-style-guide/issues/328[jeremiah-c-leary/vhdl-style-guide#328]. As of January 2021,
https://github.com/ghdl/ghdl/tree/master/pyGHDL[pyGHDL] is the best candidate, since a prototype exists and GHDL is the most
used open source simulator and synthesiser for VHDL; however, the implementation of `pyGHDL.dom` is not complete.

Yet, there are two distinct required features with different complexity:

* Parsing the entities to get the list and types of generics and ports. This might be possible with either
https://github.com/ghdl/ghdl[GHDL] or https://github.com/kraigher/rust_hdl[rust_hdl] already. It would allow to identify
entities as blocks to be instantiaded in diagrams.

* Getting an schematic/RTL diagram from an architecture. This is more complex, as it requires not only parsing, but also
semantic analysis and (at least partial) elaboration of the design. The output of `ghdl --synth` might work well (either
before or after passing it to https://github.com/YosysHQ/yosys[yosys]). Nonetheless, *this is the main goal of this project*,
as it would really provide insight into existing designs.

===== (V)HDL generation/synchronization

As a complement to generating diagrams by analysing (V)HDL sources, it should be possible to generate structural (V)HDL
sources from diagrams in Hardware Studio. This is supported by many tools already, so it is not a novelty, but a need for
usability.

In this regard, it is unfortunate that neither a standard style guide nor open source automatic code formatter exists for
VHDL. As a result, keeping style consistency between handwritten and generated sources is not possible yet. Nevertheless,
see https://github.com/jeremiah-c-leary/vhdl-style-guide[VHDL Style Guide (VSG)].

==== 2.5D|3D visualization

Regarding the interface and how users interact with the design, the purpose of this project is to explore visualizatons that
go beyond collapsible/expandable 2D diagrams. Our belief is that the multiple abstraction layers in hardware designs can be
better understood and debugged by using the third dimension.

The main blocker to achieve a true 3D visualization allowing users to locate blocks at arbitrary locations is the routing.
The complexity is increased if the layout needs to be automatic. That is, in fact, a very challenging task from an algorithmic
point of view (https://github.com/SymbiFlow/ideas/issues/41[SymbiFlow/ideas#/issues/#41]). Nevertheless, so much freedom in
the visualization might be counterproductive. Hence, a semi-constrained 2.5D approach might be preferred.

Depending on implementation details, off-the-shelf Godot classes might not work. That is, the connection and port type
management logic that is provided in `GraphEdit` and `GraphNode` might need to be reimplemented. On the other hand,
https://github.com/godotengine/godot-demo-projects/tree/master/misc/2.5d[2.5D Demo Project with GDScript] exists.
Nevertheless, this is far below other features in the priority list.

Moreover, 2.5D or 3D visualizations are a good fit for virtual reality (VR) devices. The usability of VR for real-time
navigation of (V)HDL designs is to be tested. We are not convinced about it, because text editing is expected to be an
important task of the development process. Anyway, Godot supports VR and AR (see
https://godotengine.org/article/godot-3-vr-and-ar-support[Godot 3's VR and AR support]), so it would be relatively
straightforward to try it once other features are ready.

==== Gamification of hardware design and https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourth_Industrial_Revolution[Industry 4.0]

Since most hardware designs are indeed logic puzzles, there are lots of synergies between describing systems in (V)HDL and
several game types. This is specially so because VHDL is a parallel/concurrent language, co-execution of multiple cooperative
modules/components is _natural_. The most obvious games are the ones where electrical circuits are used, or which are based
on playing with logic gates and Boole's algebra:

* https://store.steampowered.com/app/290020/LogicBots/[LogicBots]
* https://store.steampowered.com/app/970800/Short_Circuit_VR/[Short Circuit VR]
* https://store.steampowered.com/app/282760/Circuits/[Circuits]

However, many strategy and survival games focused on building, automation and resource management can also be easily related.
The following list is a very small subset of circuits designed in games with basic hardware logic features, albeit not being
a relevant mechanic in the game.

On a different category, (advanced) simulation environments mimicking real world industrial machinery/vehicles are gaining
popularity. Those are sometimes developed together with custom input devices, frequently reusing the actual controls from the
target plant.

Since FPGAs are a good fit for advanced industrial control applications, it is appealing to test control designs against the
CAD models of the plant (if available). In this regard, several CAD and 3D modelling suites (such as https://www.freecadweb.org/[FreeCAD]
or https://www.blender.org/[Blender]) are gaining scripting/animation support too, which allows simulation of mechanisms and
collision detection:

Consequently, due to Godot providing easy to use engines for both 2D and 3D, adding HDL simulation features to Hardware Studio
would allow building interactive learning environments. See https://github.com/dbhi/vboard[Virtual development board for HDL design]
and https://umarcor.github.io/ghdl-cosim/vhdl202x/[VHDL DPI/FFI based on GHDLâ€™s implementation of VHPIDIRECT].

==== Integration with other tools

As explained, we aim to reuse existing tools when possible. For editing VHDL, projects such as VSCode, Emacs, Vim... all are
good solutions. GHDL provides a https://github.com/ghdl/ghdl-language-server[language server] to be used with any of them.
Moreover, https://github.com/TerosTechnology[TerosTechnology] provides a VSCode extension with multiple advanced features for
working with VHDL and VUnit: https://github.com/TerosTechnology/vscode-terosHDL[vscode-terosHDL].

For waveform visualization, either http://gtkwave.sourceforge.net/[GtkWave] (https://github.com/gtkwave/gtkwave[github.com/gtkwave/gtkwave]),
https://wavedrom.com/[Wavedrom] (https://github.com/wavedrom/wavedrom[github.com/wavedrom/wavedrom]) or https://github.com/Nic30/d3-wave[d3-wave] might be used. Nonetheless, *replaying* waveforms in Hardware Studio's frontend dataflow diagram (e.g., by colouring connections)
would be interesting for allowing *animated simulations*. Related reference: https://github.com/umarcor/pulseview/tree/ghdl/ghdl[Reading waveforms from HDL simulators with PulseView].
