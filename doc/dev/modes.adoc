==== Tiles

TileMaps in Godot can be square, isometric or custom shaped.
The isometric view is used by many projects for faking 3D, while using 2D nodes.
Actually, it's possible to render 3D assets as 2D sprites.
However, the isometric view falls short when handling the depth and/or the height.
Moreover in TileMaps assets are measured in pixels.
That is desirable for games based on pixel-art, but cumbersome for a diagram editing tool.
As a result, Tiles in Hardware Studio are square, while Spatial is used for isometric or other visualizations.
