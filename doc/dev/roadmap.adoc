=== Roadmap

* [ ] Define the format/classes for, at least:
** [ ] `Data`
** [ ] `Repository`
** [ ] `Project`
** [ ] `Entity`
** [ ] `Architecture`
* · Extract entities and architectures by parsing HDL sources:
** [ ] VHDL
*** Using GHDL's Python interface: https://github.com/ghdl/ghdl/pull/1449[ghdl/ghdl#1449]
** [ ] Verilog
*** Verilator?
* [ ] Define the content of the (internal) _utils_ repository: gates, combinatorial, sequential...
* [ ] Show the tree structure of the current design in tab _Design_ from window _Repositories_.
* [ ] Define/update the content of _Block details_ in windows _Repositories_, depending on the selected unit (in the tree or in the diagram).
* [ ] Redefine the routing of the connections (currently, splines/bezier curves).

* · Generate HDL sources from _ArchGraph_:
** [ ] VHDL
** [ ] Verilog
* · Generate _ArchGraph_ from:
** [ ] VHDL
** [ ] Verilog
** [ ] ICE
* · Synch _Entities_ and HDL sources:
** [ ] VHDL
** [ ] Verilog
* · 2.5D
** [ ] Minimap
** [ ] Layers/groups
