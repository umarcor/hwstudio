=== Internationalisation and localisation

Godot supports translating games/tols by importing CSV files, or using https://www.gnu.org/software/gettext/[gettext]'s
`*.po` format. See https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/tutorials/i18n/index.html[docs.godotengine.org: Internationalization].

IMPORTANT: Hardware Studio is in a very early design state and no internationalisation was done yet. Should you be interested
in helping, https://github.com/umarcor/hwstudio/issues/new/choose[let us know]!
