Hardware Studio (_hwstudio_) is a graphical design environment for hardware modelling, focused on (V)HDL.
It allows describing systems by arranging and connecting blocks in a diagramming tool.
Unlike other similar tools, the main target of hwstudio is not https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hardware_description_language[HDL]
generation.
Instead, it is expected to be used by hardware designers for gaining insight into their models and for easing cumbersome
tasks, such as connections in large structural architectures or co-simulation with non-trivial software models.

[WARNING]
====
This is a work in progress proof of concept and not actively funded/developed.
A diagraming tool which is kept in sync with HDL sources needs to integrate multiple complex features.
It is challenging to bring together the expertise in hardware design with knowledge about software architecture, and
spare time for devoting to open source tooling.
Hence, this repository contains several iterations to try putting together existing pieces:

* https://www.gnuradio.org/[GNURadio] is a development toolkit for software-defined radio and signal-processing. It provides
a GUI tool for creating flow graph designs, used to work on simulation. See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:GNU_Radio_Companion_(3.8.1.0)_Screenshot.png[Wikipedia: GNU Radio Companion (From GNU Radio 3.8.1.0) with a simulation Flow Graph].
Feature-wise, the GUI provided by GNURadio is very similar to Godot's VisualScript (implemented through `GraphEdit` and
`GraphNode`). The main reason for picking Godot is the simplicity for building packages for multiple platforms. GNURadio is
based on C++ and Qt; hence, the build process is more complex. However, examples about co-simulating GNURadio and Verilator
models have been reported (see https://github.com/gnuradio/gr-verilog[gnuradio/gr-verilog]). Therefore, there are multiple
opportunities for collaboration.
