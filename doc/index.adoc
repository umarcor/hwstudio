== Installation

This repository is early work in progress and no regular/tagged releases are available yet. However, after each commit is
pushed, CI workflows produce artifacts. Latest artifacts are published as assets of pre-release _nightly_:
https://github.com/umarcor/hwstudio/releases/tag/nightly[github.com/umarcor/hwstudio/releases/tag/nightly]. Just downloading
the tarball/zipfile for your platform and extracting it should work. Otherwise, https://github.com/umarcor/hwstudio/issues/new[let us know]!

The HTML5 version of the app is available at https://umarcor.github.io/hwstudio/[umarcor.github.io/hwstudio]. Note that
running the HTML5 version locally requires a web server. For testing purposes, a shell script is included in the tarball
(link:{repotree}dist/html5/serve.sh[`serve.sh`]), which will start a Docker container.

== Usage

Since *Hardware Studio* is mainly a diagraming tool, the usage should be intuitive and self-learning should be easy. If you
don't understand how some feature works, or if nothing happens when you do some action, chances are that it is not ready yet.
Feel free to https://github.com/umarcor/hwstudio/issues/new[open an issue] for discussing it!

* https://www.gnuradio.org/[GNURadio] is a development toolkit for software-defined radio and signal-processing. It provides
a GUI tool for creating flow graph designs, used to work on simulation. See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:GNU_Radio_Companion_(3.8.1.0)_Screenshot.png[Wikipedia: GNU Radio Companion (From GNU Radio 3.8.1.0) with a simulation Flow Graph].
Feature-wise, the GUI provided by GNURadio is very similar to Godot's VisualScript (implemented through `GraphEdit` and
`GraphNode`). The main reason for picking Godot is the simplicity for building packages for multiple platforms. GNURadio is
based on C++ and Qt; hence, the build process is more complex. However, examples about co-simulating GNURadio and Verilator
models have been reported (see https://github.com/gnuradio/gr-verilog[gnuradio/gr-verilog]). Therefore, there are multiple
opportunities for collaboration.

* https://github.com/Nic30[@Nic30] has prototyped an interesting ecosystem on HDL tools based on ANTLR parsers. On of the tools is https://github.com/Nic30/d3-hwschematic[d3-hwschematic], a JavaScript based solution using https://www.eclipse.org/elk/documentation/tooldevelopers/graphdatastructure/jsonformat.html[ELK JSON] as the input format.
